Identifying these biases prevents misleading visuals.\n","\n","Adjusting for Inflation:\n","When comparing values over time (e.g., prices, income), data should be adjusted for inflation to reflect real value changes.\n","\n","Deceptive Design:\n","Visualization design choices such as truncated axes, dual-axis charts, or selective time frames can distort perception.

By confronting omission of data, correcting bias, and comparing a misrepresentation of data to a truthful representation to a truthful representation of data, We learned that making visualizations honest builds trust in the charts and gives people the ability to make correct decisions.
